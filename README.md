## Welcome to Design and Demo

If you have come to this page unfortunatley you are not quite there yet. The real site is just one more step beyond this at the [Home](https://chandlerman97.github.io/design-and-demo/Home.html) page. 

The page that you are currently on is Github's ReadMe page that I am quasi forced to have for using there service.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Chandlerman97/design-and-demo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
