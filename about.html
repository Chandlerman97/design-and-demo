				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>Chandler M. Gerdes</h3>
              			<p>At the grand age of 21 years I am both a student and a salesman. I am currently going to Bellevue College and
				have been for about a year now getting my prerequisites finished up so that I can transfer to the University of 
				Washington and go into their I.M.D. program and eventually graduate from there. While I have been going to school
				I have also been working at a few different places, I was working at Microsoft for a while and then more recently
				I started working as a salesman for Seattle Lighting in Bellevue.</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>After finishing college I hope to move and work for a large company in a design and development role and/ or an
				advisory role into the world of human centric media design and more aesthetically/ user pleasing UX UI. I hope to 
				also continue to work on my own projects. Maybe eventually developing a full experience project entirely my own.</p>
